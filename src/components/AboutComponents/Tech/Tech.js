      Tech I Love
    </h3>
    <p>
      As a front-end developer, I'm open to anything that delivers a beautiful
      user experience. I've been coding in React a lot recently, and though I am
      enjoying combining logic with presentation in the same file, I'm
      'framework agnostic'. It's all about the outcome, not the tools! That
      said, developing this site on Gatsby has been a joy and I'll be using it
      whenever I can in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe strongly in learning the foundations well: semantic HTML,
      well-structured CSS and clean JavaScript. My understanding of the latter
      came a long way after reading Kyle Simpson's series, You Don't Know JS,
      which I couldn't recommend enough.
